### Installation

In order to use this project, after cloning it please download the assets here on my [Mega Repository](https://mega.nz/#F!tb50BTRQ!TzSZVXUuLfZHhYyQ2Jmxqw).

Download the entire folder as .zip and extract folders at root of the "Assets" folder of your Unity Project.

Or, you can download each folder individually and extract files following the structure below.


- Your project's hierarchy must follow the pattern :

```sh
/cod_zombies_like
	|
	/unity_cod_zombies_like
		|
		/Assets
			|
			/models
			/sounds
			/textures
```

Only files with huge size will need to be downloaded apart from GitHub.
